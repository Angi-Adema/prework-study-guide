# PreWork Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The PreWork Study Guide Webpage was created to help the bootcamp student have a main frame from which to stay organized and to track learning in the prework phase of the bootcamp. The website serves as a reference point with which to refer in order to review and refer back on covered topics for study purposes.

In the PreWork portion of the bootcamp, we learned about CSS and HTML and how these form the frame of a website and give the website character. With JavaScript we were able to add functionality to the webpage. Throughout the whole process, we learned about Git and GitHub and how to create a repository with which to push projects to in order to begin to understand how to work collaboratively on a project.

## Usage

Each section within the PreWork Study Guide webpage contains notes on the topics studied such as CSS, HTML, Git and JavaScript. These are helpful to refer back to in order to study and also to reference if help is needed in a future project. If we open the DevTools console, we can see how the JavaScript is running. The outline provided within the webpage provides a framework from which to see what to study first while progressing through the study material.
